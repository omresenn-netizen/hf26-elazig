# Project: Vadesiz – invoice financing marketplace for Turkish SMEs (Hacktoberfest 2026, Elazığ)

## What we are building
Small businesses (KOBİ) sell goods to big companies but get paid 60–120 days later.
Vadesiz lets a KOBİ upload a real invoice and sell it to licensed financiers (factoring
companies, banks) for cash today, at a small discount. The big buyer pays the financier
on the due date.

The core value is **trust**: an open-weight model (Gemma 4) reads every invoice and detects
fake invoices ("naylon fatura") before any money moves.

## Users and screens (Streamlit, one app, sidebar to switch role)
1. **KOBİ paneli** – upload invoice image/PDF → Gemma extracts fields → fraud checks →
   risk score → list of offers → accept best offer (mock bank transfer).
2. **Finansör paneli** – list of verified invoices with Gemma risk report and suggested
   discount rate → place an offer.
3. **Dedektör** – invoice network graph (who invoices whom); fake-invoice rings shown in red;
   per-invoice red flags explained by Gemma.

## Gemma 4 (the brain) – local Ollama
- HTTP API `http://localhost:11434`, model `gemma4`, use `/api/chat`.
- Images go base64 in the message `images` field. Send `"think": false`.
  Use `"format": "json"` when expecting JSON.
- ONE helper module `gemma.py` for all calls. Every call appends one JSON line to
  `logs/gemma.jsonl`: timestamp, task name, prompt, image file name (not the image),
  raw response, parsed result, duration in seconds.
- Gemma tasks: `extract_invoice` (image → fields JSON), `explain_flags` (flags → Turkish
  explanation), `risk_report` (invoice + buyer data → Turkish risk summary + suggested
  discount rate), `compare_offers` (offers → recommendation).
- If Gemma returns invalid JSON: retry once, then show raw text so the user can fix it.

## Fraud detection (rules in `fraud.py`, explained by Gemma)
- Duplicate invoice: SHA-256 of (seller VKN, invoice no, amount, date) already seen.
- No delivery note (irsaliye) for goods.
- Sector mismatch: seller sector vs. item category (e.g. textile company selling drinks).
- Capacity: monthly invoiced amount far above what the employee count suggests.
- Round amounts and vague items ("danışmanlık hizmeti").
- Buyer has not approved the invoice.
- Network: cycles in the seller→buyer graph (A→B→C→A) and shell companies
  (same address, founded < 1 year ago). Use `networkx`.
Each rule returns a flag code + short detail; Gemma turns the list into a Turkish explanation.
Final decision always stays with a human: suspicious invoices go to review, not auto-reject.

## Mocked services (clearly labelled "DEMO / MOCK" in the UI)
`mocks.py`: GİB e-Fatura verification, buyer credit score (Findex-like), bank transfer,
e-signature. Deterministic fake responses based on the data files.

## Data (already in repo, do not regenerate)
- `data/companies.json` – fictional companies (VKN, name, sector, employees, founded, address).
- `data/invoices.json` – fictional invoices, including one fake-invoice ring.
- `samples/*.png` – invoice images for the upload demo.
Runtime state (offers, accepted deals) in SQLite `vadesiz.db` (built-in `sqlite3`).

## Tech stack (do not add other frameworks without asking)
Python 3.13, Streamlit, requests, networkx, pyvis (graph in Streamlit via html component).
No OpenAI / Anthropic / other cloud AI SDKs.

## Rules
- Keep code simple and readable; few files: `app.py`, `gemma.py`, `fraud.py`, `mocks.py`, `db.py`.
- UI text in Turkish; code, comments, README in English.
- Money as float TL; show with Turkish formatting (1.234.567,89 TL).

## Git
- After every task that leaves the app working, commit yourself:
  `git add -A` then `git commit -m "<short English message>"`. One commit per finished step.
- Do not push; the user pushes.
- Never commit secrets, `.env`, `vadesiz.db`.
